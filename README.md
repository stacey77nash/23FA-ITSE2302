Coursework for Intermediate Web Programming

This repository is set up to showcase assignments from intermediate web programming.
Assignments include AdobeXD layouts, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as how to employ GitHub. 

The website created for Module 1 is called "Purrfect Pets". I chose this topic to bring a warm, fuzzy feeling to anyone who visits the site. 
This website is also a vehicle for learning how to use Vanilla JavaScript within a webpage.
